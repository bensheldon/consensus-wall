Pre-Requisites
-------------------
  You must serve the Push-It assets, and include the push-it client in your web page at the location in options.staticAssetDirectory.  If you specify the staticAssetDirectory as /static/client and your application is at http://example.com, then you must serve the Push-It client at http://example.com/static/client/push-it-client.js
  
  You must start the process as root if you want flash sockets to work, as the large red warning box from Socket.IO is likely warning you (if you haven't already.)
  
Mounting Push-It
--------------------

  By default, Push-It will mount itself to '/push-it/', intercepting all requests for http://example.com/push-it/ If you'd like to change this endpoint, you may do so by setting the mountPount option.
